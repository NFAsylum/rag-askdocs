Retrieval-Augmented Generation over **any GitHub repository**: point it at a repo, it ingests the docs and code into a vector store, then answers natural-language questions grounded in that content, with cited sources.

The default corpus is [Babel](https://github.com/NFAsylum/babel-tcc) (my TCC — a multi-language code-translation VS Code extension), used throughout as the worked example.

## What is RAG?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation** answers questions by retrieving relevant text chunks from a knowledge base and feeding them to an LLM as context, instead of relying only on what the model memorized during training. This grounds answers in a specific corpus, reduces hallucination, and lets responses cite exactly which document they came from.

Nothing here is trained. The embedding model and the LLM are both used purely for inference — the corpus lives in the vector index, not in model weights. So when the source repo changes, you re-run ingestion (seconds, no GPU) instead of retraining anything. The trade-off versus fine-tuning: answer quality depends on retrieval quality — if the right chunk isn't retrieved, the LLM can't use it.

## Architecture

```

## Dataset

By default `ingest.py` shallow-clones [`NFAsylum/babel-tcc`](https://github.com/NFAsylum/babel-tcc) and indexes it. Babel is my own project, so I can judge whether answers are actually correct — a known-good corpus to validate retrieval against — and it doubles as "a RAG system over the docs of the code Babel itself processes."

Any public repo works: `python ingest.py --repo https://github.com/OWNER/NAME.git`. Restrict the scope to specific subdirectories with `--dirs docs,examples`; otherwise the whole repo is indexed. It picks up docs (`.md`, `.txt`, `.rst`, `.adoc`) and common source files (`.py`, `.cs`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.java`, `.go`, `.rs`, …), skipping build/vendor directories.

## Stack decisions

- **LlamaIndex** — orchestrates chunking, embedding, storage and retrieval without hand-rolling that plumbing, while staying thin enough to see each step explicitly (vs. a heavier agent framework).
- **ChromaDB** — embedded, file-persisted vector store; no external service to run for a single-user demo. Each ingested repo becomes its own collection.
- **sentence-transformers (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)** for embeddings — runs locally and free, so the only paid API call in the whole pipeline is the final generation step.
- **Anthropic API (Claude Haiku by default, Sonnet via `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` env var)** for generation — used in production at my previous job, so this pipeline reuses that experience end-to-end.
- **Ollama fallback** — documented here, not implemented: swap `llama_index.llms.anthropic.Anthropic` for `llama_index.llms.ollama.Ollama` in `query.py` to run generation fully locally.

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NFAsylum/rag-askdocs.git
cd rag-askdocs
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

cp .env.example .env
# edit .env and set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (get credits at console.anthropic.com)
```

## Usage

```bash
# index the default corpus (Babel docs + examples)
python ingest.py --dirs docs,examples

# ...or any other repo
python ingest.py --repo https://github.com/OWNER/NAME.git

python query.py "What languages does Babel support?"
python demo.py             # interactive CLI loop
```

`query.py` and `demo.py` always target whichever repo was last ingested.
